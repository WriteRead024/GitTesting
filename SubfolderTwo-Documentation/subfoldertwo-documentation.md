# Subfolder **Two** - Documentation

There is decent [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) 
and much additional information about git available on the web.

A basic overview of the user-useful commands is available as 
a "[cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)".&nbsp; 
Things like setting up a username and email, creating repositories, 
managing branches, and even carefully redoing commits are mentioned.

Official documentation for 
[the list of git commands](https://git-scm.com/docs) is a bit more advanced and  
assumes the user is somewhat familiar with git.&nbsp;
