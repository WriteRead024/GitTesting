### Git Testing

# Subfolder **Four** - Pull Requests

This subfolder is like a demo/test sandbox for pull requests on GitHub.&nbsp; 
The [GitHub documentation on Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) 
is surprisingly extensive.&nbsp; 
The sections on [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) 
and specifically [creating pull requests from repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) 
are particularly relevant.

This repository subfolder only deals with in-repository pull requests, not inter-(forked-)repositories' pull requests.

The process is:
1) Get a repository local copy on a development machine.
2) Create a branch with `git checkout newbranchname`.
3) Make some edits, additions, changes in the new branch.
4) Push the branch and changes to GitHub.
5) Create the pull request on GitHub from the new branch.

    The last commit message should be auto-populated in the new pull request process on GitHub.

6) Manage any conflicts, test failures, or other problems.
7) Approve or reject(?, question mark, lets see what happens) the pull request merge.
