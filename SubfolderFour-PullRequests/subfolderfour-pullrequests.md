### Git Testing

# Subfolder **Four** - Pull Requests

This subfolder is a mainly a collection of notes on pull requests using git and GitHub.

The [GitHub documentation on Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) 
is surprisingly extensive.&nbsp; 
The sections on [collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) 
and specifically [creating pull requests from repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) 
are perhaps excessive for the information needed in this testing work, but were useful in finding out information on things like
how to reject pull requests (the term is 'Close' pull requests).
