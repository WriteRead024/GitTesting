# Subfolder **Five** - Interesting Git Things

Git 'superprojects' and 'submodules' are interesting git things.&nbsp; 
From the [git documentation on the topic](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules): 
"A submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository. The submodule has its own history; the repository it is embedded in is called a superproject."
