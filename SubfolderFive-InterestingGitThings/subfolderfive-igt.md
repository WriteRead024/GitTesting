# Subfolder **Five** - Interesting Git Things

Git 'superprojects' and 'submodules' are interesting git things.&nbsp; 
From the [git documentation on the topic](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules): 
"A submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository. The submodule has its own history; 
the repository it is embedded in is called a superproject."&nbsp; 
There is also a [page on the topic](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git/Submodules_and_Superprojects) 
in the [Wikibook on the topic](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git) that might be helpful.
