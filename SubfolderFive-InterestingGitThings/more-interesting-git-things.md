## Reference Information about *Git Forks*

['Telusko' YouTube Video about forks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5NrYIa_aG4) from Aug 12, 2017 - 
shows forking a git project on the GitHub website then creating a simple pull request 
with one new file from the fork to the original repository.&nbsp; Nothing ground breaking, the 
computer operator and narrator is very happy to be making the video.&nbsp; He owned both involved 
GitHub accounts and was glad to accept his own pull request good naturedly.
