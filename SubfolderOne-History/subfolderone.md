### Git Testing

# Subfolder **One** - History

Fun fact about the source control management tool 'git' is that 
the development of git was started (, according Wikipedia) in 
April 2005 by the widely famous creator of the Linux kernel.&nbsp; 
I would mention that person by name, but I am still wrapping my 
head around the level of productivity that represents.&nbsp; 
There are multiple citations concerning the fact, so there is 
not reason for doubting it.&nbsp; 
In fact, the story given on the Wikipedia page concerning 
[the history of git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History)
 it sort of seems like the persons style.&nbsp; 
 Very impressive.
