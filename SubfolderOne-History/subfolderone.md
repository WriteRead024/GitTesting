# Subfolder **One** - History

Fun fact about the source control management tool 'git' is that 
the development of git was started (, according Wikipedia) in 
April 2005 by the widely famous creator of the Linux kernel.&nbsp; 
I would mention that person by name, but I am still wrapping my 
head around the level of productivity that represents.&nbsp; 
There are multiple citations concerning the fact, so there is 
not reason for doubting it.&nbsp; 
In fact, the story given on the Wikipedia page concerning 
[the history of git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History)
 rather seems like the tremendously productive and 
 open-source software enthusiast person's style.&nbsp; 
 Very impressive.&nbsp; A official git website 
[page about the history of git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)
does not give quite the same emphasis 
to the creator of Linux being the creator of git, but does 
tell a very similar story.
