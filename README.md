# Git Testing

This repository is intended as a sandbox for testing the branch, merge, pull request type functionalities of Git (and GitHub.com).

All code and text is MSL.l.

#### TODOs

- [ ] fast-forward testing, as from the Express JS release process markdown documentation "Using a fast-forward merge keeps the history clean as it does not introduce merge commits."
- [ ] demonstrate that fetch can be nicer than pull as pull is like fetch and updates the local branch to the most recent commit
- [ ] that branch merge thing from 12/11/2024 notinotes
- [ ] rebasing
- [ ] show rebasing is like merging but has cleaner commit history
